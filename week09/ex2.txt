Hit occur when the referenced page is already in the memory, and miss occur otherwise. Thus, Hit ratio = 1 - Miss ratio.

So, the more identical references in the sequence, and the larger the number of page frames would be,
the more hit ratio, and the lower miss ratio are.
And vice versa, the wider pull of references in the sequence, and the smaller the number of page frames would be,
the lower hit ratio, and the more miss ratio are.

So, the sequence of only one page reference (n, n, n, ...) would have hit ratio very close to 1, and miss ratio very close to zero.
In fact, Hit ratio = (length - 1)/length, and Miss Ratio = 1/length

And the sequence like (a_1, ..., a_n, a_1, ..., a_n, ...) for some positive integer n, where all a_i are distinct, would have hit ratio near zero, and miss ratio close to one.
Here, Hit ratio = 0, and Miss ration = 1 if the number of page frames is less than n.
